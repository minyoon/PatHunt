## What is class\_count?

class\_count (temporary name) is an analytic engine for the trends of patent classes. Every year, companies apply patents, and each patent has its own classes. The tool allows users to visualize such trends for specific companies; hence, users can easily explore and compare the output data.

## Usage
1. Users can analyze the company's direction by looking at their recent patent classes.
2. Users can examine patent classes for specific companies in a certain time frame.
3. Users can hover over the plot, and the information box automatically updates with relevant data.
